## How did you do this?
- Scrapped [this website's data](http://www.learnchineseez.com/read-write/), using the script inside `./scrap`.
- Very simple react application, using one component only (this could be splitted into more components in the future).
- Bootstrapped using `create-react-app`.

## Why?
I needed this two years from now. I would use a **very basic** scrapper back in time, using jquery â€” yes, jquery.

I kept learning Chinese, at school this time, and I thought this could definitely help my classmates to learn how to write Chinese. If you ever found such a tool, please reach me out, I'd love to see it. I created this one as **I couldn't find any**.

Hope it helps you, somehow! Keep learning! ðŸ“–
